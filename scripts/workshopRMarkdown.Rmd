Workshop 2 - RMarkdown

# The aim 

We want to present the results and the visuals in ways that are easier to share with people. We will knit the RMarkdown file into a PDF or a the webpage, so people can have all the info in one place together (with the code if it is a webpage).

We will create a webpage using RMarkdown and publish it as a GitHub page.

# Details {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Let's take a closer look what we can have in a webpage.

## 1. Header 
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/header.png")
```

## 2. Table
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/float toc.png")
```

## 3. Tabs
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/tabs.png")
```

## 4. Code button
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/show code.png")
```

# Structure and Essentials

As we have mentioned in the last workshop (or not), we suggest you to have some folders to keep everything tidy.

* data: your data
* scripts: for the scripts, including .R and .Rmd files
* docs: for the output
* images (optional): for the images 


## Files 
There are two files you must have to publish a webpage:

1. index.html: default homepage
2. _site.yml:  provides the global YAML header for the site

Download the template from Bug of the week repo.


## YAML header 

yaml header controls the overall appearance of the page.<br>
